# Basic Arithmetic

print(7)
print(7.656)
print(-7.66)
print(3+4) # + - / *
print(3*4+5), print(3*(4+5))
print(10%3) # 1st divided by 2nd and gives remainder
my_num = -5
print(my_num)

print(str(my_num) + "my fav number")
# print(my_num + "my fav number") - this will give an error

# More advanced Math operations
print(abs(my_num))      # gives absolute of number
print(pow(my_num, 3))   # 1st number, 2nd power
print(max(4, 6))        # gives max, min gives minimum
print(round(3.5447))    # rounding operation

# Importing
from math import*
print(floor(3.5447))    # chops off decimal point (0.7)
print(ceil(4.67))       # returns the smallest integer number which is greater than or equal to n
print(sqrt(36))         # square root of num
